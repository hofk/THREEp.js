# THREEp.js

# currently still alpha version

THREE.js addon, to produce almost infinite many time-varying Geometries and BufferGeometries with polar / spherical functions

In contrast to THREEf.js, polar / spherical coordinates are used here for the functions.
This results in a different set of properties and functions.

...
_The addon is developed step by step._

_currently only indexed and non indexed BufferGeometry_

NEW  in THREEf r88 as well:

explode,			// 	function ( t )			// factor for exploded view (only non indexed BufferGeometry)

# Use sandboxTHREEp.html to experiment. #
